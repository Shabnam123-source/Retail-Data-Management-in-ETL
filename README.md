# Retail-Data-Management-in-ETL
This project enhances ABC Retail's data management capabilities using AWS 
Glue, an ETL service, to streamline data processing workflows and derive 
actionable insights from sales and product data. It aims to integrate and analyze 
data from multiple sources to understand customer behavior, product 
performance, and market trends. This integration leads to data-driven decisions 
that optimize inventory management, marketing strategies, and overall business 
performance.
